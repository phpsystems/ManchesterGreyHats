A talk by one of our members on the common tools and techniques used to break into a server, starting from enumeration and going to full exploitation.

For anyone wanting to play along, please bring a laptop with Kali installed (a virtual machine is okay - make sure you have the latest version of wpscan by running the command "wpscan --update") as well as a copy of [this vm](https://download.vulnhub.com/mrrobot/mrRobot.ova)
